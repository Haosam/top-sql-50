# ðŸ‘€ SQL Practice: Authors Who Viewed Their Own Articles

## ðŸ“˜ Table: `Views`

| Column Name | Type | Description                                          |
|-------------|------|------------------------------------------------------|
| article_id  | int  | ID of the article that was viewed                    |
| author_id   | int  | ID of the author who wrote the article               |
| viewer_id   | int  | ID of the person who viewed the article              |
| view_date   | date | Date on which the article was viewed                 |

- No primary key (duplicate rows allowed)
- If `author_id = viewer_id`, it means the author viewed **their own** article

---

## ðŸ§© Problem

**Write a SQL query to find all unique authors who have viewed at least one of their own articles.**

âœ… Return the result **sorted by `id` in ascending order**  
âœ… Column should be named `id`
