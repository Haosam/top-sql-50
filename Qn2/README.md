# Qn 584. Find Customer Referee

# ðŸ§  SQL Practice: Filter Customers Not Referred by ID = 2

## ðŸ“˜ Table: `Customer`

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                   |
|-------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| id          | int     | Primary key; uniquely identifies the customer |
| name        | varchar | Name of the customer                          |
| referee_id  | int     | ID of the customer who referred them          |

- `id` is the **primary key**.
- `referee_id` can be **null** (if no one referred the customer).

## ðŸ§© Problem

**Write a SQL query to find the names of customers who were _not_ referred by the customer with `id = 2`.**

âœ… **Return the result in any order.**
